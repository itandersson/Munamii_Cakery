<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Create a simple web page

<br/>

## Task<br/>
The client Munamii Cakery has a cupcake shop on Instagram where she sells 
cupcakes and wedding cakes.<br/> She is interested in having a website to have a more
formal presence on the web,<br/> where she can customize how she presents the 
information to her clients.<br/>
After some conversations via email, she has decided to start with a small website to 
see how her consumers react to having a website,<br/> before committing to a more 
expensive e-commerce site (that would require back end coding)
Specifications requested by the client
<br/>
<br/>
• The site must work on phones and also computers.<br/>
• Must have min. 4 pages: Home page, About page, Products page, Contact page.<br/>
• The Product page must be divided into Cupcakes and Wedding cakes.<br/>
• There must be at least 8 Cupcakes on the Product page.<br/>
• There must be at least 8 Wedding cakes on the Product page.<br/>
• Each product must have a picture, a title and a price.<br/>
• The header must have a link for each of the 4 pages.<br/>
• The footer must have links to Instagram and Facebook.<br/>
• The footer also must have a link to contact her via email 
(redacted)<br/>
